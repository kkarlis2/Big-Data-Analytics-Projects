# Big-Data-Analytics-Projects
## 📘 Overview

This repository contains two academic projects developed as part of the *Large-Scale Data Management Systems* course of the MSc in Information Systems at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).

### 📁 Project 1: Ultra Race Data Warehouse (Apache Spark & Power BI)

A full pipeline for building a data warehouse in star schema format using Apache Spark. The project focuses on analyzing ultra-marathon race performance data (2015–2022), and generating statistical reports. The results are visualized through Power BI dashboards.

**Technologies**: Apache Spark, CSV, Power BI  
**Concepts**: ETL, star schema, OLAP, dimensional modeling, time-based analytics

### 📁 Project 2: Airline Network Graph Database (Neo4j)

A graph-based modeling and querying project using Neo4j and Cypher. The dataset models airports, airlines, and routes as a property graph. A set of analytical queries explores the structure and traffic of the global flight network with focus on specific countries and route types.

**Technologies**: Neo4j, Cypher, CSV  
**Concepts**: Property graphs, graph modeling, shortest path, pattern matching, indexing

---

Together, these projects demonstrate practical skills in both **relational/OLAP-based analytics** and **graph-based querying**, using real-world datasets and modern data tools.
